# Osteoporosis Risk Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is focused on analyzing Osteoporosis, a bone disease that occurs when the body loses too much bone, makes too little bone, or both, leading to weak and brittle bones. The objective is to download data from trusted sources, perform data loading and transformation, visualize risk factors influencing Osteoporosis, develop a logistic regression model, and conduct prediction analysis.
